# Requirements

The only requirement for using the Datafeedr API is a set of API keys which can be [purchased here](https://members.datafeedr.com/subscribe).

Datafeedr API keys consist of an **ACCESS ID** and an **ACCESS KEY** which must be included in all API Requests.

See the [Usage Limits](#usage-limits) section for more information on API Request limits.
