## Datafeedr API Docs ( [https://datafeedr.github.io/datafeedr-api-docs/](https://datafeedr.github.io/datafeedr-api-docs/))

[Datafeedr](http://www.datafeedr.com/) has over 10 years experience processing affiliate network data feeds to enable website owners to easily find and display relevant affiliate products on their WordPress websites.

In those 10 years we have grown our database to over **400 million affiliate products** from 12,000+ merchants and 30+ affiliate networks which we keep updated on a daily basis.

The Datafeedr API is a **single access point** to all of that affiliate data.

Our API provides a powerful interface that enables you to programatically find and filter product and coupon data from the [affiliate network and merchants we support](http://www.datafeedr.com/networks) giving you the keys to build something awesome!

In the event you receive a `5xx` response from our servers, it implies that we have hit an unexpected spike in API access traffic and we typically will be operational within the next 5 minutes.
